## About Extension

Toggle snap.js file from the webpage.

### Installation

First, head over to chrome://extensions, which you can type or paste directly into the Chrome search bar. On the top right, there will be an option to turn on Developer Mode. Go for it.

Some new features will appear, including an option to Load unpacked, which you can use to import a folder containing a new extension.
